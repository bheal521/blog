Hi, I'm Ben.
===============
I am a consultant at [ASR Analytics], a federal consulting firm in Washington DC. Currently, I'm working on a project that seeks to quantify the benefits of a whole bunch of federal stimulus dollars that were spent on building out [broadband infrastructure] across the country.

On the side, I like to work with data by tinkering with Python and R. Sometimes this involves basketball statistics, other times it involves mapping the best sandwiches in DC... As a budding data scientist, my goal is to learn by doing. This blog gives me a chance to document the things I learn about along the way.
