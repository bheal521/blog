##Hi, I'm Ben.##

I am currently a graduate student at [NC State's Institute for Advanced Analytics]. I left my job at [ASR Analytics], a consulting firm in Washington DC, to head back to school ([Billy-Madison-style]) 
and continue developing my abilities to work with all kinds of different data. The program at NC State is one of a growing number of statistically focused data science degrees, but we think
that we are the [best]. Specifically, our program attempts to cross various disciplines including: 
data management, statistics, data mining (and the linear algebra behind it), text mining, machine learning, survival analysis, risk analysis, and the list goes on... My favorite 
part of the program is learning how to apply all of these techniques using different tools/techniques, creating visualizations and communicating the results.

This website is yet another outlet for me to build on my data analysis skills by tinkering around with a handful of projects. 
In general, I'm using things like Python, R, and SAS in an attempt to find something interesting 
hidden in some data. The topics will vary, but will deal with whatever is piquing my interest at the moment! These things include: sports, good food, 
and rad tunes. As a data enthusiast, my goal is to learn by doing -- this site gives me a chance to document some of 
the things I learn about along the way. I'll try to keep any code I've developed for past and on-going projects up to date on [GitHub]. Check out my [Contacts]
