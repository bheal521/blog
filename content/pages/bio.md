##Hi, I'm Ben.##

I am a data enthusiast currently working for Liberty Mutual in Boston. My team works to better understand what makes our customers tick, how we can improve their experience in meaninful ways, 
and how to use our data to build long-lasting relationships with them. 

As graduate of the University of Massachusetts and, more recently, North Carolina State University, I am a proud State School alum. I completed my Master's in Analytics at 
[NC State's Institute for Advanced Analytics] after realizing I could play with data for a living. The program at NC State is one of a growing number of statistically focused data science degrees, but we think that we are the [best]. 

This website is an outlet for me to tinker around with a handful of projects. 
In general, I'm using things like Python, R, and SAS in an attempt to find something interesting and visualize it in a way that communicates that point.
The topics will vary, but will deal with whatever is piquing my interest at the moment! These things include: sports, good food, 
and rad tunes. As a data enthusiast, my goal is to learn by doing -- this site gives me a chance to document some of 
the things I learn about along the way. I'll try to keep any code I've developed for past and on-going projects up to date on [GitHub]. 

Interested in a more formal look at my experience? Check out my [resume].
