##Hi, I'm Ben.##

I am a consultant at [ASR Analytics], a consulting firm based in Washington DC. Currently, I'm working on a project that seeks to quantify the 
benefits of a whole bunch of federal stimulus dollars that were spent on building out [broadband infrastructure] across the country. Soon, I am headed even
further south from my native Massachusetts to go back to school at NC State in Raleigh, NC. I'll be getting my Master of Science in Analytics at their
Institute of Advanced Analytics [(IAA)](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/). The program is a hybridized mix of several competencies including: data management and quality, 
statistics, and tools/techniques for effectively visualizing and communicating results.

In my spare time, I am continuing to build on my data analysis skills by tinkering around with a handful of projects. In general, I'm using
Python and R (with a heavy dependency on both of their respectively awesome online communities) in an attempt to find something interesting 
hidden in some data. The topics will vary, but will deal with whatever is piquing my interest at the moment! These things include: sports, good food, 
and rad tunes. As a budding data scientist, my goal is to learn by doing. This site gives me a chance to document some of 
the things I learn about along the way. I'll try to keep any code I've developed for past and on-going projects up to date on [GitHub]. Check out my [Contacts]
page if you'd like to get in touch in some way shape or form!
